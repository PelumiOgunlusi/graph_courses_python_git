# Description of the  India TB Pathways dataset

*The India TB Pathways dataset is based on a study conducted in Vellore district, Tamil Nadu, India. It xamines the pre-diagnostic costs and health-seeking behavior of 880 new adult pulmonary tuberculosis atients registered at Primary Health Centres (PHCs).*

```{python}
India_TB = pd.read_csv('india_tb_pathways_and_costs.csv')
show(India_TB)
```

# Bivariate plot of the relationship between age and length of treatment initiation delays in days  

```{python}
px.histogram(India_TB, x='Age', y='Treatment initiation delay (in days)')
```
As observed in the plot above, , extremely young and extremely old individuals attending various PHC in Tamil Nadu, India faced shorter delays compared to adults within the age of 44-64 which is quite expected as these individuals are generally more healthier relative to the children and the aged.

# Higlighting Key numbers with inline 

```{python}
max_delay = India_TB['Treatment initiation delay (in days)'].max()
corresponding_max_age = India_TB.loc[India_TB['Treatment initiation delay (in days)'] == max_delay, 'Age'].iloc[0]
print(f'The maximum treatment initiation delay was {max_delay} days, and the corresponding age was {corresponding_max_age} years.')
```

```{python}
min_delay = India_TB['Treatment initiation delay (in days)'].min()
corresponding_min_age = India_TB.loc[India_TB['Treatment initiation delay (in days)'] == min_delay, 'Age'].iloc[0]
print(f'The minimum treatment initiation delay was {min_delay} days, and the corresponding age was {corresponding_min_age} years.')
```
